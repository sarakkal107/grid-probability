# Grid Probability

## Step 1: Test File Generation
In order to generate the test maps and corresponding data, run the generate.py script. To change the size of the grid, modify the row and col variables definied at the top of the file. 

*** NOTE: When generating the files, we do utilize index 0, so all generated paths also utilize 0. To match up with the visualization, we added 1 to each coordinate. ***

## Step 2: Visualization
In order to visualize the test maps and corresponding data, run the visualize.py script. Change the folder, mapFile variable, and dataFile variable in order to change which visualization is seen.
